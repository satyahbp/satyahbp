                Well! It's always difficult to reply when someone says, "Tell me something about yourself." We think a lot, but nothing comes spontaneously. So, to solve that problem, I thought of writing something about myself here. </p>

            <p class="more_para">
                I'm a tech, finance and science enthusiast. I love to learn new things a lot. Sometimes I write something, sometimes I only read, and a lot of times I watch videos, they maybe tutorials, interivews, science videos, tech reviews or book reviews, and also some cat videos. I love watching cats. Lovely creatures, aren't they! Anyway, I was saying that I enjoy doing everything that improves my understanding of the world. 
            </p>

                Once I wanted to convey my thoughts to the world, so I started a blog on Wordpress. You can check it out  <a href="https://solitaryblogger417.wordpress.com/">here</a>. Along with that I have a Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/solitarybloggerhbp">Click Here</a>) where I write book reviews and similar stuffs, and a YouTube Channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbhk3y9cHd_oYlWMkhFWW5A">Click Here</a>) to support the same. Currently both are at a nascent stage, and I'm planning to work on them in future.

                For me, quality always matters more than quantity, and I've always tried to execute that in my life. While choosing any path, I prefer going step by step instead of jumping directly on something that is difficult to handle. Having said that, I also believe that there are certain times when we just have to take that leap of faith, because life is always uncertain, we never know what will happen! These are certain basic principles with which I live my life, and try to enjoy it to the highest point possible.
